# Thio Joe Site
 Website for ThioJoe's Youtube comment spam purging tool.
 
 Recently, there has been a massive infestation of spam on YouTube where fake impersonator accounts leave spam/scam replies to hundreds of users on a creator's videos. YouTube has fortunately now made it so the "Hide User From Channel" button instantly removes all of that user's comments, but there are sometimes many different spammers, and it can be difficult to find them all.

Therefore I created this script to allow you to easily scan for and purge these spammer comments. IT DOES NOT PREVENT SPAMMERS - It only makes it easier to delete them when they show up! YouTube still must implement better native tools for dealing with spammers.
